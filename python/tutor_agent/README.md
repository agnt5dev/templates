# AI Tutor Agent — AGNT5 Template

A multi-subject educational assistant that routes student questions to specialized tutors using the agent handoff pattern.

## What it does

- **Triage** — A triage agent analyzes the incoming question and detects the subject area (history, math, or general).
- **Handoff** — Control is transferred to the appropriate specialist agent, which provides a focused, expert response.
- **Specialize** — A history tutor and a math tutor each have dedicated instructions tailored to their domain.

## Key concepts

- **Agent handoffs** — The triage agent uses `handoff()` to transfer the conversation to a specialist. The specialist handles the question end-to-end and returns the final response.
